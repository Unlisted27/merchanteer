Project description:  
A CLI based game about ancient seas and trade. Have you ever been bored in a console? If you're anything like me, you sure have, but all of the console games are too basic or too complex. I aim for a happy medium: an enjoyably challenging game about networks, something we devs sure enjoy (I see u Factorio players).

AI use:  
1. Less than 30% of my project is AI, but I prefer to be transparent  
2. I have one rule using AI: Never use AI if you don't understand (or learn) its code. Let's break it down: Repetitive simple tasks? Let Co-Pilot handle it. Logic that you are too lazy to implement? ChatGPT can give you an outline. That said, if you refuse to read or understand the code that AI writes, you aren't doing yourself a favour; you are just obstructing your learning.  
  
How to run:
